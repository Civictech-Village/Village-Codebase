### üìù Summary

A study published in the Journal of Personality and Social Psychology found that people were more likely to sign a petition to save a local park if they believed that their neighbors were also concerned about the park's future ([APA](https://www.apa.org/pubs/journals/psp)). Similarly, a study published in the Journal of Consumer Research found that people were more likely to boycott a company if they believed that their friends and family were also boycotting the company ([APA](https://psycnet.apa.org/record/2004-16173-007)).

These studies suggest that social influence can play a powerful role in shaping our willingness to take action on issues that we care about. When we see that others are also concerned about an issue, it can make us feel more confident that our actions will make a difference. It can also help us to feel less alone and more connected to others who share our values.

In any form of change or movement, the people are the most vital piece. Any elected official can just brush off the voice of one person saying they have a problem, but it's a lot harder when you have hundreds or thousands of people rallying behind a common issue. ‚ÄúCommunity organizing enables people to turn their resources into the power they need to make the change they want (Chow). Power comes from our commitment to work together to achieve a common purpose, and commitment is developed through relationships.‚Äù ([Open Library](https://ecampusontario.pressbooks.pub/communitydevelopmentpractice/chapter/community-organizing-people-power-and-change/#:~:text=7.-,Strategies%20for%20building%20relationships%20for%20community%20organizing,commitment%20is%20developed%20through%20relationships))

### üòû The Problem 

People are trying to solve real issues in their communities such as heating, rent inflation and even card driving too fast in their neighborhoods. People love their communities and want to make it better. But, if you‚Äôre not deeply engaged with the community already, then you may not realize that you are not the only one with that problem. According to a 2018 study by the Pew Research Center, only 29% of Americans say they are very or somewhat involved in their local community ([pew](https://www.pewresearch.org/social-trends/2018/05/22/americans-satisfaction-with-and-attachment-to-their-communities/)). The same study found that only 18% of Americans say they have attended a meeting of a community group or organization in the past year. A 2019 study by the National Conference on Citizenship found that only 40% of Americans say they feel a sense of civic duty to help solve problems in their community ([NCOC](https://ncoc.org/)).
